Implementation of Linear Regression of with multiple variables from scratch

I have implemented linear regression with multiple variables in python using jupyter notebook. Dataset used in this implementation can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who">here</a>.

I have used only those parameters which add postive change in life expectancy with their increase. There are multiple other parametesrs which make negative impact on life expectancy.
